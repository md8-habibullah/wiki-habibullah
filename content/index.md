> Welcome to my **Digital Garden**. Unlike a traditional blog, this is a collection of interconnected thoughts, raw notes, and technical documentation. It is a living network of what I learn, build, and break.

> ## [The User](https://habibullah.dev)
**[MD. HABIBULLAH SHARIF](https://habibullah.dev)**
*Full-Stack Developer | DevOps Engineer | Security Enthusiast*

I am undergraduate at University, obsessed with the intersection of reliable software engineering and offensive security. My philosophy is simple: **Engineer clean, break often, secure always.**

Currently, I am operating out of a **Linux** environment, focusing on building infrastructure that scales and writing code that survives.

> ## Knowledge Graph
This garden is organized into several high-level domains. Click a node to explorer.

### 1. Development Stack
My core toolkit for building applications.
* **Frontend:** `[[Next.js]]`, `[[React]]`, `[[Tailwind CSS]]`
* **Backend:** `[[Node.js]]`, `[[TypeScript]]`, `[[Python]]`
* **Database:** `[[PostgreSQL]]` (The gold standard)

### 2. Infrastructure & DevOps
Where code meets production.
* **Containerization:** `[[Docker]]` & `[[Kubernetes]]`
* **IaC:** `[[Terraform]]` (Infrastructure as Code)
* **CI/CD:** `[[GitHub Actions]]` pipelines

### 3. The Void / Security
* **Ethical Hacking:** CTF Writeups, Burp Suite configurations, and payload research.
* **Linux:** Deep dives into Fedora, Kernel tweaking, and Ricing.

> ## Selected Projects

> [!tip] GitHub Highlights
> For code, visit my [GitHub Profile](https://github.com/md8-habibullah). Below are the architectural breakdowns.

* **Secure Full-Stack Systems:** Implementation of JWT Auth, RBAC, and SQL Injection prevention patterns.
* **Real-Time Monitoring:** A `Socket.IO` dashboard for visualizing live metrics.
* **Cloud Automation:** Automating AWS resource provisioning using Terraform.

---

> ## The Manifesto
I believe in the **"Free Forever"** and **"Open Source"** way of life.
* **Tools:** I prefer tools that respect user freedom (Linux, Neovim, Firefox).
* **Learning:** I document what I learn. If I can't explain it in a `[[Wiki]]` note, I don't understand it well enough.
* **Vibe:** A dark terminal, a cup of tea, and Qur'an recitation in the background.
